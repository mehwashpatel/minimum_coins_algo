Minimum number of coins needed to make change for x


File 1.0.php is a solution for question Given the coins 1, 5, 10, 25, 100, 200, what is the minimum number of coins needed to make change for x? For instance if you need to make change for 53 cents you need five coins, two quarters (25 cents), and three pennies (1 cent). You have an infinite number of coins to dispense change with.

File 1.1.php is an upgrade on the old file which adds one more coin 53 into the array, which leads to the algorithm change to find the suitable solution.
